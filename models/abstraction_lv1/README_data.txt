Requires Jinj2 v2.9+

This folder should act as a place to store templates by category.
Use build_code.py to create a new python file from a set of templates.

Each template should have a *_data.py and *_template.py file.
The rendered template will be saved in the folder one level up e.g. "../*.py".

build_code.py has more documentation.
