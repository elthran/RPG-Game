Test combat simulator. 

1. Should be able to: 
    a. Simply login, 
    b. go to "users" page. 
    c. Click on the other user. 
    d. Click battle. 
    e. The console should print out the health of both users each round (after attacks are made). 
    f. Should stop when someone reaches 0 health. 
    g. Then revisiting user page should show new healths. 
    h. If enemy is dead you should no longer be able to battle them.
    
If anything else happens (like you are both still alive, they are dead but you can fight them, etc.) then let me know. But I think I fixed all bugs. Just get confused between summed_profs and base profs. Please check and make sure I did it correctly.

2. Can you merge the time branch into master branch if it's fixed? I want to work on it WITH my battle code.
    a. Like have all players heal every 30 seconds.
    b. Then mix that in with my battle code.
    c. Like attack them,
    d. let them heal,
    e. attack them again.
    f. See if there are any bugs. I want to get it all ironed out before I progress
