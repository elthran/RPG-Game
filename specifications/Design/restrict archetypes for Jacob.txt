let me lok up the exact specs that i want and lets try to code it
But this really isn't necessarily the best way to go about it ..
thats fine ?? as long as it works for now
*description="User views the {}.".format(page.url?)
ok the specific triggers i want are

if hero.attributes.brawn.level >= 3:
    brute_archetype = True

and

if hero.abilities.alchemy.level >= 3:
    philosopher_archetype = True
so all the archetypes should be locked. getting 3 brawn (an attribute) unlocks brute. and getting 3 alchemy (an ability) unlocks philosopher
if we can get both of those hacked together, then i think i can expand it to do the others and messa round
We could add a Locked attribute to all the Archetype classes?
And implement a specific unlock method in each?
sure
Hmmmm ..
sounds like something we will need
I'm going to copy this conversation and try and work it out toonight.
ok. and im going to prepare the HTML/CSS/JS
right now clicking on an archetype on the archetype page immediately turns you into that archetype. but ill make it instead give a description of requirements if you click on it, with a button. the button will be grayed out if its locked
actually, i dont think this requires triggers now that i think about it. just when you load the page to choose archetype it needs to check the requirements
in the future you would want triggers for it in case you wanted a pop-up message or something when you hit the trigger. but for now i really just need to do it on that one page load
so for now i could just load the page and do a simple,

if condition met:
    button works
else:
     button grayed out
ill try and code it all today, then if you want to improve it tonight you can ?? but after thinking about it, it seems simple enough
