I would like to set in some business/finance code at some point. 
We could make the art in the game choseable by the Player and then pay the artist based on their 
useage metrics. It would sort of turn the game into a "marketplace" for both Artwork and 
Storytelling (you could pay people to write missions too).

Well I think that we should charge a Monthly fee. And have all content (or most) free.
But then we would pay the artists based on whether people chose to use their content.
It would encourage people to create cool content for the game. And thus bring in more users.

Would could build this content creation architecture right into the game. Allowing player to create items,
locations, maps, art, etc. We would be essestially running and "art gallery" with a clean and
interesting viewing mechanism.
