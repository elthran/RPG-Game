Install Bash on Windows.

Install all requirements for eralachemy
via python + pip (these run python2.7)
also needs mysql? (I can't remember)

Then install all requirements for RPG-Game
using python3 + pip3 (running python3.5 or so).
definitely needs mysql (but special py3k vesrion)

Then debug the shit out of MySQL because it doesn't work.
Lots of user setup and server debug and other shit.

Then make a nice link in the bash home folder to the game
and run:
$ python3 app.py

Then run
$ eralchemy -i "mysql+mysqldb://elthran:7ArQMuTUSoxXqEfzYfUR@localhost/rpg_database" -o "static/er
d_from_sqlite.pdf"
