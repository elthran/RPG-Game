A Python comment ...

Maybe this file should even be a python module?
In theory it should tell the main program that when you create a Town(class) named
"Thornwall" it should load Thornwall.txt and when it loads this file it will
know that Thornwall has 3 shops named "Blacksmith", "Barracks" and "Marketplace".
These shops should have generic Shop(class) code with specific data for Thornwall
defined here?

Eg.
Blacksmith
--Item1
--Item2
--Item3

Where each item could be looked up in a database or a similar file for items?
God this would be so much better as a database.
