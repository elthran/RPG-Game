This folder should act as a place to store templates by category.
In the real world it would be a database but I'm not that good at databases yet.

Eg. 
The "towns" folder should contain data for each town.
Given a town name of "Thornwall" the town name should be the file name.
The file should be broken up into sections for locations in each town.
Eg.2
   Blacksmith
   Shop
   Old man's hut

These locations would then auto load each location as part of the towns main menu.
