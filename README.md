# RPG-Game

A basic text based adventure game. With less and less text and more pictures and fancy JS buttons and tooltips all the time :P

This should sort of work like a choose your own advernture game. You will explore the world and as you find out more about it you will have to make more and more complex choices about what you want to become.

To get this project working you need to download (at least):
- python 3.5 (won't work with higher versions yet)
- Flask
- SQLAlchemy
- git

There are probably more ... and maybe at some point I will make some links to a guide or two.
I also use:
- Chocolatey
- Pycharm Community edition
- Alembic

And through Python 2.7 pip:
- ERAlchemy
- pygraphviz

## Some history ...
This started out as a way for Elthran and I (Marlen) to learn programming and really geek out about how much we liked gaming. Our main discussions centered around what we wanted in games, what we liked, what we missed and what was important to us.

I then promply took a several year leave and Elthran and Jimmy (who started some time after I left) kept working on the project. I was amazed that Elthran had kept working and tried to relearn coding and jump back in. I am really glad they kept going as I have had a lot of fun working on this project.

(No doubt @Elthran will add some stuff here at some point ... )
