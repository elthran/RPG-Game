Current concerns:

I'm probably mangling session usage again.
In services.validate I'm doing a auto-closing query? I think?
This calls services.attempt_password_migration .. which might close the session.
Or open a close a different one? Anyways I'm not user of the chain of custody
of various session objects.
Note use of Account.save() delete and rebuild the session

I'm not even sure if my Fancy Session manager (models.base_classes.Base.query -> database.sessions.session_scope) will actually commit changes or not? Or if it even closes ...


NEED TO TEST is object.filter_by() .. will save properly!
