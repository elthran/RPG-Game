Current concerns:

Is it possible to migrate tavern quest code?
Is marketplace code dead code?

Old concerns:

I'm probably mangling session usage again.
In services.validate I'm doing a auto-closing query? I think?
This calls services.attempt_password_migration .. which might close the session.
Or open a close a different one? Anyways I'm not sure of the chain of custody
of various session objects.
Note use of Account.save()/delete() and rebuild the session

I'm not even sure if my Fancy Session manager (models.base_classes.Base.query -> database.sessions.session_scope) will actually commit changes or not? Or if it even closes ...


NEED TO TEST if object.filter_by() .. will save properly!
